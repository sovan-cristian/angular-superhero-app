First project in Angular framework - This project utilizes Angular, Bootstrap and JSON server. The concept of the app is similar to the tour of heroes project from Google's Angular page, but I created this app during my participation in the web development course from Scoala Informala de IT.


The app makes a request to the JSON server and populates all the different superhero data in bootstrap cards:

Each card can be edited, deleted and the superpowers associated with each superhero cand be deleted from here. Additionally, more can be added from the modal view:

Superpower modal:

New superheroes can be added to the list by filling in a form. When adding a link for the image, it will be dinamically loaded underneath the corresponding form input, as a preview:
